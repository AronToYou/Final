    <h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>
      <p>  The goal of our project is to make a simulation of fire that is as realistic as possible.
        We plan to study and use the generic method of physically modeling a system of interacting particles in order to acheive this,
        which involves solving the relevant PDEs numerically in order to predict the dynamics of the system.
        We also hope to explore other alternatives to a physically based rendering -- in particular we may try to exploit
        the dynamics exhibited by certain simplified probabilistic models in their "scaling limits", in order to
        render fire in a way that is not physically based but is visually appealing.</p>
    <h2 align="middle">Background and Problem Description</h2>
      <p>The phenomenon of fire, like most natural processes, can be complicated to describe and intricate geometrically. Thus, if one wants to
         render convincing looking fire on a computer graphics display, a non-trivial approach must be adopted. In general, fluid dynamics are described by the
         Navier-Stokes equations. As analytically solving Navier-Stokes is intractable, numerical methods are generally used to intgrate the PDE.
         We believe that similar techniques will need to be used for fire simulation, although the dynamics may be more complicated.
         Additionally, a traditional mesh would be inefficient to modulate in time with the solutions of the NS, thus we must caste the solution
         into a more suitable framework.</p>

      <h2 align="middle">Goals and Delivarbles</h2>
        <p>Our central goal for the project is to create a realistic simulation of fire. We propose to first implement an engine to simulate the dynamics of combustion. We will investigate primarily 2, but possibly other
           established techniques, to organize the framework to be rendered. We will numerically calculate the solutions to Navier-Stokes
           equations, which describe the motion of gaseous densities, thus giving us a description of fire to frame into a rendering engine.
           To measure the quality of the system we will observe the smoothness and fluidity of the simulation and compare it to real fire.
           Our base deliverable would be a simple video showing our simulation along with a high level overview of the math behind it,
           as well as the essential aspects of our implementation. </p>
        <p>We hope to create an applet with a simple user interface that can be used to display our simulation in an interactive way.
           Other aspirations we have include implementing refraction from the heat on a background, and modeling the spread of fire so that
           our simulation is not purely stationary.

        </p>
    <h2 align="middle">Schedule</h2>
      <p> Week 1: Finish assignment 4, and decide whether to use this project as skeleton code for our fire simulation.
          Also in week 1, we plan to read relevant references on the subject and study existing implementations.
      </p>
      <p> Week 2: We hope to try to have a prototype of a working simulation.
      </p>
      <p> Week 3: Refine the simulation, experiment with parameters to tune, possibly experiment with an alternative
        method of implementation.
      </p>
      <p> Week 4: We leave our "hopes" for this week. In particular, during this week we hope to write
        an applet that has a simple user interface with which we could display our simulation. We also hope to
        be able to simulate fire in 3D environment, and to be able to capture the visual effect of "mirage"
        or "heat haze", which occurs because the temperature gradient in the air is high,
        causing light to bend in unusual ways.
